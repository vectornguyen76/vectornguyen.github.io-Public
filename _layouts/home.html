			<h4>Welcome!</h4>

			<p>Hi, I'm Vector Nguyen, an AI Engineer with a passion for building practical and efficient Machine Learning systems. My journey in AI began during my Mechatronics Engineering studies at HCMUTE. After graduating, I started in software development before moving into AI at FPT Software Quy Nhon, where I worked on Semantic Search for Computer Vision and NLP, while learning MLOps.</p>

			<p>After two years, I returned to Saigon to join FPT's AI Center, focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs), multi-agent systems, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I have experience building advanced chatbots, AI systems, and multilingual solutions for international clients.</p>

			<p>I also work with microservices, cloud technologies, and DevOps to create scalable AI applications. In my side projects, I've developed a large-scale search engine and a real-time face recognition system, solving challenges in data processing and computer vision.</p>
			
            <p>Beyond my work, I'm passionate about contributing to the open-source community on GitHub. I'm always excited about the next public template or project release, eager to collaborate and share new innovations with the world.</p>
