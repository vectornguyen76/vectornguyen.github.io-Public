Hi, I'm Vector Nguyen, an AI Engineer with a passion for building
practical and efficient Machine Learning systems. My journey in AI began
during my Mechatronics Engineering studies at HCMUTE. After graduating,
I started in software development before moving into AI at FPT Software
Quy Nhon, where I worked on Semantic Search for Computer Vision and NLP,
while learning MLOps.

<p>
After two years, I returned to Ho Chi Minh city to join FPT's AI Center,
focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs), multi-agent systems, and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I have experience building
advanced chatbots, AI systems, and multilingual solutions for
international clients.
</p>

<p>
I also work with microservices, cloud technologies, and DevOps to create
scalable AI applications. In my side projects, I've developed a
large-scale search engine and a real-time face recognition system,
solving challenges in data processing and computer vision.
</p>

<p>
Beyond my work, I'm passionate about building AI applications on GitHub.
I'm always excited about the next public project release, eager to
collaborate and share new innovations with the world.
